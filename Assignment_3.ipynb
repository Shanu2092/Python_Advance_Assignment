        "When class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement, it is considered as class attribute. Change in the value of class attribute will affect all the instances of the class.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans. In class, if the variable is declared without self then it is accessible within that function only, kinda local variable. However if it declared using self like self.variable_name = 'somevalue', then it is accessible via any object but not via the class name.\n",
        "\n",
